pydeep
------

Python/C bindings for the ssdeep library at http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net

hash_buf / hash_bytes - returns the ssdeep hash for a given buffer
hash_file - returns the ssdeep hash for filepath
compare - returns the % match between 2 hashes


import pydeep
pydeep.hash_buf('somedata')
pydeep.hash_file('path-to-file')
pydeep.compare('hash1','hash2')


Replacing pyssdeep with pydeep
------------------------------
pyssdeep was segfaulting manytimes on OSX. Thats why i quickly wrote pydeep

instead of :

    *   from ssdeep import ssdeep
    *   s = ssdeep()
    *   s.hash_file('some-file') 

you can replace the first 2 lines with :
    *   import pydeep as s

And you should be all set
